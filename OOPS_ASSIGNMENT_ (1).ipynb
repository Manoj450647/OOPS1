        "\n",
        "### 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code. It focuses on using reusable code and creating programs based on real-world entities. Key principles of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, brand):\n",
        "        self.brand = brand\n",
        "    def drive(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"Driving a {self.brand} car\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with attributes and behaviors defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\")\n",
        "my_car.drive()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Abstraction** hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features.\n",
        "* **Encapsulation** hides internal data and enforces access through methods to protect the state of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods with names like `__init__`, `__str__`, etc., used to perform special operations in classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def __str__(self):\n",
        "    return \"String representation\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties and methods of another class. It promotes code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Bark\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It means the same method can behave differently in different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Bird:\n",
        "    def fly(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Bird flying\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Sparrow(Bird):\n",
        "    def fly(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Sparrow flying\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Encapsulation is achieved by making attributes private using `__` and accessing them using getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class BankAccount:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self.__balance = 0\n",
        "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "        self.__balance += amount\n",
        "    def get_balance(self):\n",
        "        return self.__balance\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** A constructor is a special method `__init__` that is called automatically when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Class methods** use `@classmethod` and take `cls` as the first parameter.\n",
        "* **Static methods** use `@staticmethod` and don't take `self` or `cls`.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Python doesn't support method overloading directly. Instead, default arguments or variable arguments are used to achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** `@property` is used to make a method act like an attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Circle:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "        self._radius = radius\n",
        "\n",
        "    @property\n",
        "    def radius(self):\n",
        "        return self._radius\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** It allows code reusability and flexibility by enabling one interface to be used for different underlying forms (data types).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and must be inherited. It contains one or more abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "class Shape(ABC):\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",
        "    def area(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "```\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Modularity\n",
        "* Code reusability\n",
        "* Scalability\n",
        "* Easier maintenance\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** When a class inherits from more than one base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "class B:\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "class C(A, B):\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Class variables are shared by all instances of a class.\n",
        "* Instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `__str__`: Returns a readable string representation of an object.\n",
        "* `__repr__`: Returns a developer-friendly string representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** `super()` allows you to call methods from the parent class, useful for method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** It is a destructor method that is called when an object is deleted to perform cleanup activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 22. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `@staticmethod`: Doesn't take `self` or `cls`. Acts like a normal function in a class.\n",
        "* `@classmethod`: Takes `cls` and can modify class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** It allows subclasses to provide specific implementations of methods already defined in the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line by returning `self` from methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Example:\n",
        "    def set_value(self, x):\n",
